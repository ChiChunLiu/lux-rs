# lux-rs

lux-rs is a Lux interpreter that follows the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html) book.
For ease of comparison to the Java version, lux-rs aims to use the same names as those in **Crafting Interpreter** as much as possible,
subject to language specific casing conventions. However, lux-rs adheres to idiomatic Rust. e.g. it may use enum when inheritance is needed.
